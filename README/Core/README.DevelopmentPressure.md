# Dynamical Memory Engine — Development Pressure Reference

## Purpose

This document guides development pressure, prioritization, and feature admission for the Dynamical Memory Engine.

It does **not** override:
- `README_MasterConstitution.md`
- `README_WorkflowContract.md`
- active Door boundaries

Its role is to help answer:

**What should we build next, and why is that complexity justified now?**

---

## 1. Realistic Development Path

This project should grow in a grounded sequence so usefulness and complexity stay coupled.

The planning vocabulary in this note follows the active constitutional staircase:

```text
Door One → Door Two → Door Three
```
Where:

Door One = deterministic structural memory and bounded recognition runtime
Door Two = trusted temporal cognition stack
Door Three = participatory intelligence ecology

Development pressure should only advance when the current Door is stable enough to justify the next one.

Door One — Structural memory and bounded recognition

Timeframe: now → ~12 months

Goal:
Build and harden a lawful structural memory system for dynamical signals.

Expected deliverables:

deterministic ingest pipeline
replay-honest runtime artifacts
trajectory storage
basin / regime organization
structural query tools
bounded workbench / HUD inspection surfaces
provenance retention and replay support

What this proves:

the system can faithfully capture state evolution
structural memory can be stored, queried, replayed, and inspected honestly
lawful repeated-run comparison is possible without canon inflation

Possible artifacts:

open source runtime / library
research demo
interactive visualizer
diagnostic workbench

Likely audience:

ML researchers
control engineers
simulation developers
telemetry / diagnostics practitioners

Pressure rule at this stage:
Prefer runtime honesty, inspection honesty, provenance, replay support, and real-device usefulness over upward semantic expansion.

Door Two — Trusted temporal cognition

Timeframe: ~1–2 years

Goal:
Turn the stabilized Door One substrate into a trustworthy temporal diagnostic instrument.

Expected capabilities:

explicit canon promotion criteria
lawful canonical state formation
regime shift detection
anomaly detection
trajectory similarity search
structural compression with trusted replay posture
temporal comparison over stabilized memory

Example use cases:

debugging AI training
robotics telemetry analysis
simulation diagnostics
complex system monitoring
long-horizon behavior review

What this proves:

the substrate is not just a memory store
the system can answer meaningful diagnostic questions through trusted temporal structure
canon and temporal reasoning can be introduced without corrupting Door One law

Possible outputs:

research tools
consulting
collaborations
niche commercial software
canonical review workflows

Pressure rule at this stage:
Do not move here just because Door One is interesting. Move here only when Door One is stable enough that promotion criteria and temporal trust questions become the real bottleneck.

Door Three — Participatory intelligence ecology

Timeframe: ~2–4 years

Goal:
Build agentic and ecological systems that operate on lawful structural memory and trusted canon rather than token prediction alone.

Possible capabilities:

prediction loops
regulation policies
adaptive behavior
memory recall
regime-aware control
multi-agent interaction
symbolic abstraction
reflective or self-governing behavior

Possible applications:

autonomous research agents
adaptive control systems
AI training monitors
intelligent infrastructure
symbolic / ecological memory systems

Meaning:
This is where phase-controller, agentic, ecological, and symbolic architecture become meaningful — but only after Door One and Door Two are truly stable.

Pressure rule at this stage:
Door Three must inherit from lawful lower layers. It must not be pulled downward into Door One or Door Two through excitement, metaphor, or roadmap leakage.

## 2. Complexity Policy

Every new mechanism must justify its existence.

Rule 1 — Capability Test

A feature must enable a new measurable capability.

Example:
“detect regime transitions”

If it does not unlock a real new capability, reject or defer it.

Rule 2 — Simplification Test

A feature may be admitted if it reduces total system complexity.

Example:
replacing five ad-hoc heuristics with one general mechanism

Rule 3 — Interpretability Test

A feature should improve one or more of:

replayability
explainability
observability
Rule 4 — Use-Case Justification

Every feature should connect to a plausible real problem domain.

If no real use case can be named, defer it.

Rule 5 — Reversibility Principle

New mechanisms should be:

modular
removable
testable

This prevents architectural lock-in.

Rule 6 — Layer Legitimacy Test

A feature must be admitted at the lowest lawful layer and must not import deferred semantics into active scope.

This rule exists to keep development pressure subordinate to constitutional boundary law.

Rule 7 — Door Legitimacy Test

A feature must belong to the currently active Door unless Reed explicitly advances scope.

Questions to ask:

Is this still Door One work?
Is this actually a Door Two pressure?
Is this a Door Three idea arriving too early?

If the feature belongs to a later Door, defer it rather than smuggling it downward.

## 2.5 Inspection-surface pressure rule

As Door One stabilizes, development pressure may shift from missing runtime law to read-side semantic overhang.

This means a surface can remain code-lawful while still encouraging users to over-read review labels, interpretive summaries, or promotion-adjacent framing more strongly than the underlying provenance and runtime evidence justify.

When this happens, the next justified feature is usually not more semantic layering.
It is stronger inspection posture.

Inspection-surface admission test

Before adding new interpretive, review, or promotion-adjacent display surfaces, ask:

Does the new surface preserve provenance visibility?
Does it preserve raw/runtime evidence visibility?
Does it visually separate runtime evidence from interpretation?
Does it visibly fence review posture away from canon or truth?
Does it improve replayability, explainability, or observability?

If the answer is no, defer the feature or tighten the inspection surface first.

Preferred response to inspection-surface drift

When read-side semantic density begins to outrun provenance salience, prefer:

provenance-first display ordering
stronger runtime/audit visibility
explicit derived / non-authoritative labeling
review-surface demotion or collapse-by-default
drill-down links from labels back to evidence

Prefer these before adding new semantics, new review packaging, or promotion-adjacent UX.

Door One visual ordering guideline

For Door One inspection surfaces, the preferred evidence order is:

Provenance
Runtime Evidence
Interpretation
Review Surfaces

This ordering is not a new authority layer.
It is a read-side discipline intended to keep provenance and runtime evidence visually primary while Door One remains below canon.

## 3. Use-Case Contract

Every major feature should answer a real question.

System Feature	Question It Answers
Trajectory state buffer	Is the system converging or drifting?
Basin detection	Are we revisiting known regimes?
Trajectory query	Have we seen this behavior before?
Regime shift detection	When did the system change modes?
Structural similarity	What past states resemble this one?

If a feature cannot answer a real question, it waits.

## 4. Development Flywheel

The intended loop is:

Door One capability hardening
      ↓
enable better analysis / inspection
      ↓
discover useful diagnostic questions
      ↓
identify real-world use cases
      ↓
add minimal lawful features
      ↓
stabilize the current Door
      ↓
only then justify the next Door
5. Practical pressure guidance by Door
When Door One is active

Prefer:

runtime honesty
provenance
replay support
inspection clarity
bounded real-device usefulness
anti-bypass discipline

Defer:

canon pressure
prediction pressure
symbolic framing
agentic behavior
ecological layering
When Door Two becomes active

Prefer:

explicit promotion criteria
temporal trust questions
canonical state review
lawful temporal comparison
diagnostic usefulness over flourish

Defer:

full agency
symbolic expansion
participatory ecology
When Door Three becomes active

Prefer:

inherited law from lower Doors
bounded agent roles
explicit memory/canon dependence
ecological clarity
symbolic and meta functions only where they remain auditable
6. Final pressure rule

The right next feature is not the most exciting feature.
It is the smallest feature that resolves the current Door’s most honest bottleneck without importing the next Door prematurely.
