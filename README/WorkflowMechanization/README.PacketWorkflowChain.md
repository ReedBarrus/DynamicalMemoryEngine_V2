# README.PacketWorkflowChain.md
# Dynamical Memory Engine — Packet Workflow Chain

## Status

This document defines the bounded packet workflow chain for the Workflow Mechanization facet in DME.

It is a supporting workflow-facet note.

It does **not** override:

- `README_MasterConstitution.md`
- `README_WorkflowContract.md`
- `README_RepoPlacementConstitution.md`
- `README.WorkflowMechanizationScope.md`
- `README.MechanizationClosureGate.md`
- `README.StructuralIdentityLaw.md`

Its purpose is narrower:

- define the staged packet chain used for bounded implementation work,
- define how packets move through the workflow staircase,
- define the relationship between packet scope, audit, routing, and acceptance,
- define when packet fission, deferment, escalation, or review is lawful,
- and preserve bounded closure discipline across multi-step development.

This note governs **packetized workflow progression** only.

It does **not** govern:

- runtime artifact meaning,
- operator contracts,
- canon activation,
- architectural truth,
- or autonomous workflow authority.

---

## 1. Why this note exists

DME now develops through bounded packets rather than open-ended implementation flow.

That shift exists to reduce several recurring risks:

- large tasks outrunning seam capacity,
- broad prompts hiding multiple distinct subproblems,
- declared completion outrunning real closure,
- helper tools drifting into redesign,
- and packet scope becoming ambiguous across role handoff.

The packet chain exists to prevent those failures.

A packet is not merely a task label.
It is a bounded development object that must:

- preserve a declared seam,
- preserve a bounded objective,
- preserve explicit non-goals,
- preserve authority posture,
- preserve reviewability,
- and preserve lawful closure conditions.

The packet chain is therefore the primary movement grammar for bounded workflow progression.

---

## 2. Core packet rule

**Every implementation packet should advance one bounded seam through one lawful closure target at the lowest layer that honestly resolves the active problem.**

This means:

- one packet should prefer one active seam,
- one seam should prefer one bounded objective,
- one objective should prefer one honest completion condition,
- and one completion condition should remain auditable.

If a packet cannot be stated clearly enough to preserve these, it is likely:

- too large,
- too mixed,
- too early,
- or not yet an engineer packet.

---

## 3. Packet chain overview

The packet workflow chain is:

1. scope
2. spec
3. implement
4. audit
5. route
6. accept / revise / defer
7. merge
8. checkpoint
9. accumulate regime pressure
10. trigger stronger review only when justified

This chain should remain explicit.

A packet is not complete merely because code was written.
A packet is complete only when its bounded closure target has been honestly reviewed and its next posture is explicit.

---

## 4. Packet stages

## 4.1 Scope

A packet begins when a bounded seam and bounded objective are declared.

Scope must identify:

- the active seam,
- the bounded goal,
- explicit non-goals,
- files in scope,
- governing notes,
- preservation rules,
- and acceptance target.

If these cannot be stated clearly, the packet is not yet lawful.

## 4.2 Spec

The packet is then expressed as an Architect Task Spec Packet.

The spec defines:

- what should be changed,
- what must not change,
- how completion will be judged,
- and where escalation is required if the seam cannot be completed honestly.

The spec packet is intent.
It is not implementation reality.

## 4.3 Implement

Engineer performs bounded implementation against the active seam.

Implementation should prefer:

- the smallest lawful patch,
- the lowest lawful layer,
- explicit test backing,
- and explicit non-claims where completion is partial.

Implementation may return:

- complete
- partial
- blocked
- escalated

A partial or blocked return is still lawful if it is honest and bounded.

## 4.4 Audit

Every implementation return must be audited.

Audit asks:

- did the packet preserve its bounded question?
- did it preserve seam identity?
- did it preserve functional role?
- did it preserve authority posture?
- did it preserve lawful routeability?
- where is distortion, drift, or uncertainty present?
- what is now true?
- what is still not claimed?

Audit is where packet honesty is enforced.

## 4.5 Route

After audit, the packet must be routed.

Valid packet routes include:

- accept
- revise
- narrow
- defer
- escalate
- split / fission
- merge only after acceptance
- park for later door pressure
- mutate under explicit review

Route must remain explicit.

Unrouted packets create workflow ambiguity.

## 4.6 Accept / revise / defer

A packet may be:

### accepted
The bounded closure target is satisfied honestly.

### revised
The packet was close, but requires another bounded pass.

### narrowed
The packet must continue under a smaller seam or reduced claim.

### deferred
The packet is not lawful to complete now, but may remain valid later.

### escalated
The packet cannot be completed honestly without architectural or boundary clarification.

These states are workflow states, not truth states.

## 4.7 Merge

Merge occurs only after packet acceptance.

Merging is a repo state change, not a substitute for review.

A merged packet should remain:

- bounded,
- identifiable,
- reviewable by diff,
- and attributable to a lawful packet history.

## 4.8 Checkpoint

After meaningful packet closure, the repo may be checkpointed.

A checkpoint should preserve:

- active packet identity,
- what is mechanized,
- what remains partially mechanized,
- what was accepted,
- and what remains deferred.

Checkpointing is a workflow memory surface, not an authority uplift.

## 4.9 Regime accumulation

Repeated packet outcomes accumulate into workflow regimes.

Examples:

- stable advance
- chronic repair pressure
- mutation pressure
- false readiness
- premature expansion
- lane insufficiency
- route oscillation
- recurring seam overmixing

These regimes do not decide truth.
They inform later routing and review pressure.

## 4.10 Stronger review

Broader review, helper adjustment, grammar refinement, or new mechanization work should occur only when regime accumulation justifies it.

The packet chain therefore scales upward by evidence, not by excitement.

---

## 5. Packet classes

The workflow chain currently recognizes several practical packet classes.

### 5.1 Implementation packet

A bounded code or test patch packet.

Examples:
- backend honesty correction
- model wiring
- rendering update
- seam extraction

### 5.2 Seam-isolation packet

A packet whose purpose is to reduce future implementation fragility by isolating a mixed-responsibility seam.

Example:
- extracting `FutureReplaySurfaceRegion` into its own file before behavior changes

### 5.3 Closure-gate packet

A packet that defines or enforces a bounded mechanization closure rule.

Example:
- replay reconstruction closure gate

### 5.4 README / law packet

A packet that defines or tightens supporting workflow or governance notes without changing runtime semantics.

Example:
- `README.WorkflowMechanizationScope.md`

### 5.5 Escalation packet

A packet or return whose primary purpose is to surface a lawful conflict or unresolved seam for architectural decision.

These classes are practical, not metaphysical.
They exist to preserve legibility and routing.

---

## 6. Packet fission rule

When one packet contains more than one real seam or exceeds the seam capacity of the active tool lane, the lawful remedy is:

**packet fission**

Packet fission means splitting one overlarge packet into smaller bounded packets that preserve the same overall goal through staged closure.

Packet fission is preferred when:

- one file is too large or mixed-responsibility,
- one tool lane cannot safely validate the seam,
- model and rendering seams are entangled,
- seam isolation is needed before behavior change,
- or partial completion would otherwise be mistaken for full closure.

Example pattern:

- B1 — model seam
- B2 — seam isolation
- B3 — rendering seam

Packet fission is not failure.
It is lawful compression of workflow scope.

---

## 7. Escalation rule

Escalation is lawful when a packet cannot be completed honestly within its current seam, file scope, or tool lane.

Allowed escalation reasons include:

- contract conflict
- hidden dependency
- bounded architectural opportunity
- lane insufficiency
- seam overmixing
- safe validation unavailable

Escalation exists to preserve legitimacy, not to expand authority.

Escalation must not be used to:

- redesign architecture silently,
- widen packet scope casually,
- bypass review,
- or turn implementation friction into speculative roadmap drift.

---

## 8. Merge discipline

The preferred packet merge posture is:

- bounded branch
- bounded diff
- review against packet objective
- merge only after acceptance
- keep packet identity visible in history

Normal merge or squash merge may both be lawful if packet identity remains clear.

The key rule is not the button.
The key rule is:

**the merge must preserve packet discipline.**

---

## 9. Packet completion rule

A packet is complete only when all are true:

- the bounded objective is satisfied,
- required tests/checks have passed or been explicitly accounted for,
- preservation rules remain intact,
- no undeclared architecture change was introduced,
- and what remains unclaimed is explicit.

Code written is not enough.
Branch existence is not enough.
Displayed surface improvement is not enough.

Packet completion is a closure state, not a feeling.

---

## 10. Relationship to audit and closure gate

The packet workflow chain depends on the closure gate and structural identity law.

The closure gate determines whether a capability may be called mechanized.

The structural identity law determines whether the bounded packet object is still the same lawful object across staged transformation.

The packet chain provides the movement law:

- how packets are scoped,
- how they are implemented,
- how they are audited,
- how they are routed,
- and how they accumulate into regime pressure.

These notes are complementary.

---

## 11. Development-order rule for the facet

The preferred early build order for the Workflow Mechanization facet is:

1. closure-gate pilot
2. workflow scope
3. packet workflow chain
4. structural identity kernel
5. emission/admission grammar
6. seam registry / closure-state ledger
7. address lattice
8. schema-driven stub protocol
9. helper wrappers and role-support tools
10. broader regime-aware workflow support

This order may be adjusted by Reed, but the governing principle remains:

**define law and closure before automating progression.**

---

## 12. Exclusions

The packet chain must not be used to justify:

- open-ended implementation without seam declaration
- helper authority replacing role authority
- branch existence treated as acceptance
- merge treated as proof of correctness
- packet repetition treated as legitimacy
- packet completion treated as canon or truth
- workflow convenience overriding constitutional boundary
- escalation used as redesign inflation
- packet splitting used to hide unresolved architecture
- route ambiguity preserved for convenience

The packet chain exists to reduce ambiguity, not to ritualize it.

---

## 13. One-line review question

Before closing or advancing a packet, ask:

**Is this still one bounded packet acting on one lawful seam with one honest closure target, or has it drifted into a different object that should be split, narrowed, deferred, or escalated?**

---

## 14. One-line summary

**The packet workflow chain moves bounded development objects through scoped implementation, explicit audit, lawful routing, merge discipline, and regime accumulation so closure remains honest and staged progression does not outrun seam reality.**
