Real-Source Replay Resilience Scope

Door One — Read-Side Experimental Seam Only

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the first real-source experiment scope for replay-flow and replay-resilience probing in Door One.

The immediate goal is to carry the current replay-flow probe posture into an honest real-source family and test whether the exchange-regime behavior observed in synthetic cohorts survives provenance-bearing source conditions without altering runtime authority or basin semantics. This remains a read-side diagnostic only. Runtime stays below canon.

This README does not introduce new runtime meaning, new authority classes, or new promotion logic.

## 2. Current Experimental Basis

The synthetic replay-resilience probe currently supports four isolated perturbation families:

amplitude
boundary_detuning
harmonic_offset
noise_depth

Across the current synthetic fixtures, all four families show:

baseline: oscillatory_exchange
perturbation: separated regime (one_way_drift or weak_or_inert)
return: oscillatory_exchange
family class: exchange_recovers_on_return

The current cross-family synthetic summary therefore supports the probe-local class:

resilience_surface_class = broad_recovery_pattern

This finding is useful, but remains:

provisional
probe-local
synthetic-family scoped
non-canonical

It is not yet a claim about real-source resilience.

## 3. Constitutional Posture
3.1 This experiment is allowed because it remains:
read-side
script-side
lineage-bound
reversible
observational only
3.2 This experiment must not:
modify BasinOp clustering logic
change runtime operator contracts
change workbench readiness or promotion scoring
add flow_mode, resilience classes, or derived interpretations to authoritative runtime artifacts
treat replay classification as canon, ontology, truth, or trusted prediction
silently replace structural metrics with semantic language

These remain hard boundaries for the experiment seam.

3.3 Language discipline

Use:

classification
diagnostic separation
replay resilience summary
recovery on return
probe-local resilience hint

Do not use:

prediction
truth
understanding
semantic identity
canon
validated knowledge

## 4. Primary Question

Under an honest real-source acquisition path, does the exchange condition:

persist,
weaken,
disappear,
recover on return,
or fail to recover,

when exposed to isolated perturbation families that have already shown bounded structural separation in synthetic replay?

## 5. Secondary Question

Is recovery in real-source conditions:

axis-specific,
mixed,
fragile,
or suggestive of a broader resilience surface,

while still remaining bounded to a read-side diagnostic posture?

## 6. First Real-Source Family
6.1 Selected source family

The first real-source family is:

mic_ambient_audio

This means local microphone capture on the computer is the primary real-source input.

6.2 Why microphone is first

Microphone input is selected because it is:

easy to acquire honestly
naturally continuous
repeatable with minimal integration burden
compatible with single-axis perturbation design
less entangled than CPU telemetry for a first resilience checkpoint

CPU telemetry remains a valid later source family, but is not the first real-source checkpoint because scheduler effects, background activity, and bursty operating-system behavior make perturbation isolation harder to interpret cleanly. This scope prefers the simplest provenance-bearing source that preserves experimental clarity.

6.3 Role of the phone

The phone may be used as:

a controlled perturbation source
a tone generator
a broadband noise source

The phone is not the primary capture device for the first real-source cohort.

## 7. Real-Source Acquisition Posture
7.1 Capture path

Preferred first path:

local computer microphone
mono capture
fixed sample rate
bounded run duration
explicit run labeling per replay phase
7.2 Required lineage fields

Each run should preserve enough lineage to keep replay honest, including at minimum:

- source_family
- source_device_label
- source_id
- stream_id or equivalent source identifier
- channel / modality identity
- run_label
- perturbation_family
- perturbation_label
- replay_phase
- replay_sequence_index
- acquisition timestamp or bounded cohort time range
- declared lens metadata needed to interpret the probe output
- explicit derived-vs-durable status where relevant

7.3 Non-goal

This phase is not attempting to maximize richness or realism.
It is attempting to establish a clean real-source checkpoint with declared perturbation axes and honest return conditions.

Temporal window family and hop policy must be declared per cohort. If temporal support is later tightened for short event capture, that change must be recorded as an explicit lens change and must not be hidden inside the replay comparison.

## 8. Real-Source Replay Structure

Each cohort should use the same three-phase structure already established in synthetic replay:

baseline
perturbation
return

Recommended initial timing:

baseline: 20–30 seconds
perturbation: 20–30 seconds
return: 20–30 seconds

Each perturbation family should be run separately.
Do not mix perturbation families in the same first-wave cohort.

## 9. First-Wave Real-Source Perturbation Families
9.1 Amplitude

Status: first-wave approved

Baseline:

quiet room tone

Perturbation:

repeated voice phrase, finger taps, soft claps, or controlled short energy bursts

Return:

quiet room tone again

Purpose:

test whether the exchange condition separates under simple amplitude/energy intrusion and recovers when the intrusion is removed

This is the recommended first real-source family to run.

9.2 Harmonic Offset

Status: first-wave approved

Baseline:

quiet room tone

Perturbation:

phone-generated sustained tone or hum at a declared frequency and fixed approximate volume

Return:

tone removed, quiet room tone again

Purpose:

test whether a narrow-band external source can shift the observed flow regime and whether the regime returns when the offset source is removed

Synthetic work already established an important classifier hygiene rule here: the measurement lens should remain fixed while the signal changes. The originally tempting f=10, h=20 family was rejected because it triggered oscillatory_exchange through the high flip-rate path despite lacking coherent period-2 behavior. The 8/24 redesign was adopted because it collapses honestly to weak_or_inert while preserving comparability. This same discipline should carry into real-source use: do not change the measuring frame mid-family merely to chase the perturbation.

9.3 Noise Depth

Status: first-wave approved

Baseline:

quiet room tone

Perturbation:

broadband noise introduced by phone playback, fan-like source, or other declared diffuse noise source

Return:

quiet room tone again

Purpose:

test whether increasing diffuse perturbation depth weakens, collapses, or merely distorts the exchange condition, and whether the condition recovers on return
9.4 Boundary Detuning

Status: deferred for first real-source pass unless honestly realizable

Synthetic fixtures support boundary_detuning as a lawful perturbation family. However, this is less natural at the raw microphone source level unless there is already a clear and honest way to realize boundary-targeted detuning without silently changing the lens, band definitions, or comparison basis mid-run.

Therefore, for the first real-source pass:

boundary_detuning is acknowledged
boundary_detuning is not required
boundary_detuning should be deferred unless it can be expressed without forced or weak implementation

This follows the existing experiment instruction to leave an axis out rather than force a poor one.

## 10. Recommended First Execution Order

Run first-wave real-source families in this order:

amplitude
harmonic_offset
noise_depth
boundary_detuning only if later justified

This order is preferred because amplitude is the simplest to inspect, harmonic offset is the cleanest next spectral family, and noise depth is useful once basic replay separation is already established.

## 11. Expected Outputs

The real-source replay experiment should preserve the current read-side metrics where available, including:

run_label
perturbation_family
perturbation_label
replay_phase
replay_sequence_index
boundary_band_pair
signed_cross_boundary_flow
oscillatory_flow_strength
diff_lag1_autocorr
sign_flip_rate
boundary_phase_lag_proxy
flow_mode
basin_count if already available read-side
splitting_observed if already available read-side
lineage references sufficient for replay honesty

Family-level summaries should continue to compute:

baseline_flow_mode
perturbation_flow_mode
return_flow_mode
exchange_persistence_class
flow_regime_transition_count
basin_split_persistence_summary
resilience_surface_hint

Cross-family summary may continue to compute:

perturbation_families_tested
recovery_families
non_recovery_families
resilience_surface_class
interpretation

All such outputs remain derived experiment results only.

## 12. Success Condition

The first real-source checkpoint is considered successful if:

microphone capture is integrated without runtime contract changes
baseline / perturbation / return runs are cleanly labeled and lineage-preserving
at least one real-source perturbation family shows diagnostic phase separation
return condition is meaningfully comparable to baseline
all findings remain explicitly read-side, provisional, probe-local, and non-canonical

A successful result does not require exact replay symmetry.
It requires honest separation and interpretable return behavior.

## 13. Failure Interpretations

Failure is still useful.
The following outcomes should be treated as informative, not catastrophic:

13.1 No stable baseline anchor

Possible meaning:

room source too unstable
capture chain too noisy
run duration too short
lens not yet robust enough for the source family
13.2 Perturbation does not separate from baseline

Possible meaning:

perturbation too weak
perturbation not aligned with the active interaction zone
source family insufficiently distinguishable under current basis
13.3 Return does not recover

Possible meaning:

source memory is more entangled than synthetic families
perturbation leaves persistent structural residue
real-source regime is fragile under that axis
capture posture changed between phases
13.4 Mixed or unstable classification

Possible meaning:

current flow_mode classes compress distinct behaviors too aggressively
more classifier refinement may be needed before stronger interpretation

This last point is already partially supported by the harmonic-offset family design decision: not every oscillatory-looking regime is structurally the same.

## 14. Relationship to RSI

This scope is compatible with the current DME↔RSI bridge only because it remains on allowed experimental surfaces:

- read-side interpretation
- post-run analysis
- strictly observational reflection

The experiment may provide structural evidence relevant to persistence, recurrence, continuity, and perturbation resistance.

It does not justify:
- semantic identity claims,
- canonical dimensions,
- ontology injection,
- or automatic promotion of DME features into RSI objects.

## 15. Immediate Action Plan
Step 1

Wire local mic capture into a bounded input path.

Step 2

Record source metadata and replay-phase labels for each run.

Step 3

Run one amplitude-family cohort:

baseline
perturbation
return
Step 4

Inspect:

per-run rows
family-level summary
whether return is closer to baseline than perturbation
Step 5

Only after amplitude is interpretable, run:

harmonic_offset
then noise_depth
Step 6

Defer boundary_detuning unless an honest real-source implementation becomes clear.

16. One-Line Summary

This scope moves replay-resilience probing from synthetic cohorts into first-wave real-source microphone input using isolated, declared perturbation families, while preserving Door One’s read-side-only, non-canonical, non-promotive posture.

## First file-backed mic cohort result

A first file-backed real-source microphone cohort was run from WAV recordings under:

- baseline
- perturbation
- return

### Result posture

This remains:

- read-side
- probe-local
- non-canonical
- non-predictive
- non-promotive

No runtime operator contracts, BasinOp semantics, or workbench authority were changed.

### Current structural result

For the present `daw_mic_input` cohort:

- all three phases classified as `one_way_drift`
- `exchange_persistence_class = non_oscillatory_throughout`
- perturbation remained clearly separable from baseline
- return remained much closer to baseline than perturbation

Representative replay summary:

- baseline vs perturbation band-profile L1: `0.316`
- perturbation vs return band-profile L1: `0.333`
- baseline vs return band-profile L1: `0.018`

### Working meaning

This cohort does **not** reproduce the synthetic `oscillatory_exchange` condition.

That absence is a structural finding, not a failure condition.

The useful result is different:

Door One can still distinguish baseline / perturbation / return honestly in this real-source family, and return recovery is strongly visible in band-profile geometry even when flow-mode remains `one_way_drift` throughout.

### Classifier hygiene refinement

The synthetic replay line and the real-source replay line should not be collapsed into one expectation.

- In synthetic edge-resonance families, oscillatory exchange remains the relevant splitting-facing mechanism.
- In this first mic cohort, band-profile separation is the more appropriate diagnostic surface.

This preserves replay honesty and avoids forcing a synthetic mechanism onto real-source data.

## Unlabeled master-stream phase discernment result

A bounded read-side probe was added for continuous unlabeled master WAV files in the `daw_mic_input` cohort.

### Result posture

This result remains:

- read-side
- probe-local
- provisional
- non-canonical
- non-predictive
- non-promotive

It does not modify BasinOp, runtime operator contracts, workbench authority, or promotion behavior.

### Current structural result

Across all three continuous master files, the probe found:

- two dominant candidate boundary peaks near `t≈32s` and `t≈64s`
- three candidate structural regions
- later-region return-like similarity to the early region
- cross-file agreement on the approximate boundary locations

Representative cohort summary:

- `files_processed = 3`
- `files_with_two_boundaries = 3`
- `files_with_return_structure = 3`
- `cross_file_boundary_agreement = true`
- `approximate_boundary_1_sec = 32`
- `approximate_boundary_2_sec = 64`
- `resilience_class = consistent_return_structure_across_cohort`

### Working meaning master boundary discernment

The unlabeled real-source master streams support a stable three-phase structural reading across the cohort.

This does **not** mean Door One has inferred canonical phase truth.

It means Door One can now emit provisional structural phase surfaces from continuous real-source streams using:

- candidate boundaries
- recurrence / return-like similarity
- ambiguity-aware structural comparison

### Lens discipline note

This result is tied to the declared analysis lens used by the probe, including:

- decimation
- band partition
- macro-segment duration
- boundary scoring rule
- recurrence similarity rule

Future comparisons must preserve or explicitly declare any lens change.

## Structural transition vocabulary refinement

A downstream read-side transition probe was run over the same unlabeled `master_01-03` cohort.

### Result posture

This result remains:

- read-side
- provisional
- probe-local
- lens-bound
- non-canonical
- non-predictive
- non-promotive

It does not modify BasinOp, runtime contracts, workbench authority, or promotion behavior.

### Current structural refinement

Across the current master-stream cohort, the coarse three-phase scaffold can now be refined into a richer candidate transition description:

- `dwell` in the early stable region
- `rupture` at the dominant structural boundaries near `t≈32s` and `t≈64s`
- `ingress` immediately after rupture as the stream settles into the new structural neighborhood
- `coupling` inside the disrupted middle region
- `drift` within the middle region
- `re-entry` as the later region converges back toward the initial structural neighborhood
- later `dwell` after re-entry

Classes such as `branching`, `collapse`, `decoupling`, and `distortion` were not forced where support was weak or absent.

### Working meaning

The baseline / perturbation / return scaffold remains useful as experiment choreography.

But for continuous real streams, the richer structural transition vocabulary provides a more honest read-side description of how the stream moves through profile space over time.

This remains structural interpretation only.
It is not event truth, canonical phase identity, or semantic cause.

## First tighter-band real-source family

A first tighter-band real-source family was run using a sustained `400 Hz` sine intrusion over the existing room-noise microphone baseline.

### Result posture

This result remains:

- read-side
- probe-local
- provisional
- non-canonical
- non-predictive
- non-promotive

It does not modify BasinOp, runtime contracts, workbench authority, or promotion behavior.

## Current lens status for real-source replay

The current real-source replay families have now been compared across additional structural-lens variants.

### Active preferred lens

For the present real-source families, the preferred active lens remains:

- FFT/Hann
- medium declared temporal scale
- current band-profile comparison basis

This remains the best balance between:

- replay separability
- return-like convergence
- boundary honesty
- transition-support legibility
- concentration / redistribution support fidelity

### Real FFT note

Real FFT cleanup preserved the same normalized replay structure as the current baseline.

Its value is operational:

- speed
- scalability
- future receipt honesty

It did not create a new structural distinction for the current real-source families.

### Wavelet note

Wavelet comparison showed that Haar and D4 do not outperform FFT/Hann on the current steady-state real-source cohorts.

For the narrower-band `400 Hz` family in particular, wavelet subband smearing weakens the concentration distinction that the current FFT/Hann baseline preserves well.

### Passive multi-scale note

Short / medium / long declared FFT/Hann scales all preserved the coarse replay story.

However:

- short scale increased local noise and fragmentation risk,
- long scale introduced temporal smearing near some boundaries,
- medium remained the best current compromise.

### Working result

The real-source replay line should currently treat medium FFT/Hann as the active baseline and interpret alternative transform/scale results as comparison surfaces rather than runtime replacements.

### Current structural result

For the `daw_mic_sine_400hz` cohort:

- all labeled phases remained `one_way_drift`
- baseline vs perturbation band-profile L1 was approximately `1.24`
- baseline vs return band-profile L1 was approximately `0.01`
- continuous master files showed two dominant boundaries near `t≈20s` and `t≈40s`
- later segments showed strong return-like convergence toward the initial region

### Working meaning- 400hz sine test

This tighter-band family produced a much stronger and cleaner replay contrast than the earlier broadband fan/heater cohort while remaining non-oscillatory.

The useful recovery signal remains real-source band-profile geometry and return-like convergence, not synthetic-style oscillatory exchange.

### Distortion-audit refinement

The first tighter-band family also exposed a new mechanism-level flattening:

- broadband redistribution rupture
- narrow-band spectral concentration rupture

are both currently labeled `rupture` by the structural transition vocabulary.

This is now an explicit read-side refinement target.

The next lawful step is a derived probe for spectral concentration / concentration contrast, rather than an operator rewrite.
