# README.StructuralMemoryClosureInvariant.md (Proposed)
Status

This document defines a supporting closure invariant for determining when a structure may be treated as memory-bearing at a given layer in DME.

It is a supporting governance note.

This narrowed version operates strictly as a Memory reference surface.
Constraint enforcement and structural identity law now remain entirely with README.ConstraintMatrix.md and README.StructuralIdentityLaw.md; this note only applies those constraints when deciding memory closure.

It does not override:

README.MasterConstitution.md
README.WorkflowContract.md
README.RepoLayout.md
README/Constitution/Identity/README.StructuralIdentityLaw.md
README.DeterministicInvarianceThreshold.md
README/Constitution/Mechanization/README.DeclaredVsMechanizedAudit.md
README.DoorOneProvenanceRetention.md

Its purpose is narrower:

define memory as a closure status, not a universal object type
define when a structure qualifies as memory at its layer
distinguish memory-bearing objects from residue, support, and review objects
provide a lawful negative vocabulary for non-memory states
align memory status with identity, mechanization, and workflow closure without collapsing them

This note does not define:

canon policy
truth
ontology
runtime operator semantics
promotion rules

## 1. Why this note exists

DME already defines:

structural identity (when sameness is preserved)
mechanization closure (when capability is real)
workflow conservation (how objects move lawfully)

However, one ambiguity remains:

when should a structure actually be treated as memory?

Without a clear rule, several distortions become likely:

preserved structure treated as reusable memory
replay-shaped objects treated as memory without support
similarity treated as identity continuity
retained surfaces treated as if they preserve full reuse capability
candidate or review objects treated as memory prematurely

This note defines a bounded invariant to resolve that ambiguity.

## 2. Core rule

A structure qualifies as memory at a given layer only when it can be reused for its declared bounded purpose at that layer, under its declared constraints, with sufficient surviving support and mechanized basis, without invented support, question drift, or authority inflation.

## 3. Memory is a closure status

In DME:

memory is not a universal object type.

Memory is a status a structure earns when it can be reused without lying at its layer.

This means:

different layers have different kinds of memory
runtime memory ≠ retention memory ≠ canon memory
memory status is always layer-relative
memory status must be earned through closure, not assumed from persistence

Persistence alone does not produce memory.

## 4. Closure conditions

A structure is memory-bearing at its layer only if all of the following hold strongly enough for its declared purpose.

### 4.1 Bounded purpose closure

The structure must have a clear bounded reuse purpose.

Examples:

replay support under declared lens
structural comparison under same-family constraint
retention for later reconstruction support
canon reuse within declared scope

If the purpose is unclear or shifts, memory status fails.

### 4.2 Identity closure

The structure must remain the same bounded object of inquiry.

This requires:

same bounded question
same declared constraints
sufficient surviving support
no silent mutation into a different object class

If identity drifts, the structure may remain useful, but it is no longer the same memory.

### 4.3 Mechanization closure

The structure must be supported by a real mechanized path.

It must not rely solely on:

declaration
display
preparation
candidate shaping

Declared, displayed, or replay-shaped objects without mechanized support are not memory-bearing.

### 4.4 Workflow closure

The structure must occupy a lawful workflow posture.

It must not be:

unresolved but treated as complete
deferred but treated as active
review-only but treated as runtime memory
repair/mutation pressure hidden as closure

If route posture is unclear or inflated, memory status fails.

### 4.5 Distortion closure

The structure must not collapse distinctions strongly enough to mislead reuse.

Distortion failure includes:

support flattening
ambiguity erasure
scope inflation
similarity treated as identity
digest treated as full object

If reuse would be misleading, the structure is not memory-bearing at that strength.

## 5. Memory vs non-memory classifications

If closure is satisfied:

memory_bearing

The structure may be reused as the same bounded support surface at its layer.

If closure is not satisfied, the structure must be classified as one of:

memory_supporting

Preserves support necessary for memory but is not itself fully reusable.

structural_residue

Structure remains, but reuse at the same bounded purpose is no longer lawful.

review_only

Useful for evaluation, audit, or promotion preparation, but not runtime memory.

invalid_for_memory_claim

Currently overclaiming, distorted, or misrouted beyond lawful reuse.

## 6. Layer-relative memory

Memory must always be interpreted relative to its layer.

Examples:

Door One: structural / replay-support / retention memory
Door Two: canon memory
later layers: symbolic or agent-facing memory

These are not the same object class.

They share only the closure law defined in this note.

## 7. Failure rule

If closure conditions are not met:

the system must not preserve memory language
the structure must be downgraded to a non-memory classification
reuse claims must narrow accordingly

The governing rule is:

a memory object is not whatever persists;
a memory object is whatever remains lawfully reusable at its declared layer without distortion or inflation.

## 8. Relationship to existing notes

This note composes with:

Structural Identity Law → defines when sameness survives
Mechanization Closure Gate → defines when capability is real
Workflow Mechanization Scope → defines lawful progression
Deterministic Invariance Threshold → defines support survival limits
Distortion Audit Protocol → defines misleading compression

This note does not replace them.

It defines when their combined conditions are sufficient to call something memory.
