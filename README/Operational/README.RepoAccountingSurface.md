# Dynamical Memory Engine - Repo Accounting Surface

## Status

This document defines the first bounded operational accounting surface for current-state repo/workflow placement and status tracking in DME.

It is a workflow instrument.

It does **not** override:

- `README.MasterConstitution.md`
- `README.WorkflowContract.md`
- `README.RepoPlacementConstitution.md`
- `README/Core/README.AddressRegistryModel.md`

Its purpose is narrower:

- record current-state repo/workflow placement and status,
- keep compact operational accounting in contact with live repo reality,
- provide one bounded surface for material zone/grouping/status changes,
- and support future cleanup packets without turning placement law into exhaustive inventory prose.

This note governs **present-state operational accounting** only.

It does **not** govern:

- packet lineage history,
- runtime artifact meaning,
- canon policy,
- operator contracts,
- architectural truth,
- or acceptance by itself.

This is a current-state accounting surface.
It is not a lineage log.
It is not a truth engine.
It is not a substitute for the repo.

---

## 1. Purpose

The repo accounting surface exists to answer a narrow current-state question:

**What currently lives where, what function does it serve, and where is placement/grouping pressure materially visible right now?**

This surface should remain compact.

It is allowed to track:

- active repo zones,
- live README groupings,
- material test grouping posture,
- known placement strength or placement pressure,
- and workflow-relevant status notes.

It should not be inflated into:

- a historical packet ledger,
- a full document registry replacement,
- or a file-by-file claim that outruns live repo inspection.

---

## 2. Entry Model

Each entry should preserve at minimum:

- `path`
- `current_zone`
- `object_class`
- `status`
- `door_scope`
- `function_group`
- `governing_surface`
- `placement_strength`
- `notes`

Optional fields may be added later when useful, but this surface should prefer compact operational legibility over exhaustive schema growth.

---

## 3. Update Triggers

Update this surface when any of the following become materially true:

- a file is created
- a file is moved
- a file status changes materially
- a zone classification changes materially
- a test grouping changes materially
- a README grouping changes materially
- a recurring path/reference drift hotspot becomes important enough to route cleanup

Do not update this surface merely to mirror decorative churn.

## 4. Starter Entries

These starter entries are intentionally compact.
They exist to seed the operational surface around the current cleanup pressure identified by recent workflow review.

| `hud/adapters/structuralViewerPayloadAdapter.js` | `hud/adapters/` | viewer_payload_adapter | active | door_one | one shared structural viewer payload seam across dedicated routes | `README/Diagnostics/AppSurface/README.StructuralViewerContract.v0.md`; `README.WorkflowContract.md` | strong | Shared viewer payload adapter remains the one base route seam; current state-threading packet added explicit active-state versus fallback posture without changing structural primacy or optional future seams. |
| `README/WorkflowMechanization/` | `README/WorkflowMechanization/` | workflow_note_bank | active | cross-door | workflow law, packet flow, and mechanization-support notes | `README.RepoPlacementConstitution.md`; `README.WorkflowContract.md` | strong | Real live README zone for workflow governance/support notes; now explicitly accounted as part of README compression hygiene. |

This is the live mechanized lane for bounded Language Kernel work and remains below runtime/HUD integration. |

It does not become repo-global model orchestration or runtime infrastructure. |

Artifacts here remain audit/evaluation outputs, not authority objects. |
| `tests/` | `tests/` | verification_bank | active | cross-door | repo verification surface | `README.RepoPlacementConstitution.md`; `README.WorkflowContract.md` | medium | Function-first grouping improved by PKT-TEST-GROUPING-003; some tests may still remain outside the newly legitimized high-confidence families. |

| `hud/HomeRouterShell.jsx` | `hud/` | app_surface_shell | active | door_one | top-level home/router posture above dedicated viewer routes | `README/Diagnostics/AppSurface/README.AppSurfaceTransitionPlan.v0.md`; `README.WorkflowContract.md` | medium | Thin routing surface introduced for app-face split; current state-threading pass lets the shell and routes read published execution context without embedding execution controls directly. |

## 5. Operational Use Rule

Use this surface when the question is:

- what currently exists,
- how it is currently grouped,
- where placement pressure is currently visible,
- or what workflow-facing cleanup seam is presently active.

Do not use this surface when the question is:

- how a packet flowed historically,
- whether a patch was accepted,
- what runtime behavior is true,
- or whether a seam is architecturally legitimate by itself.

Those questions belong elsewhere.

## 6. One-Line Summary

This note is the bounded current-state operational accounting surface for repo/workflow placement and grouping posture; it is not lineage history, runtime meaning, or canon policy.
