# README/Constraint/README.MechanizationClosureGate.md
# Dynamical Memory Engine — Mechanization Closure Gate

## Status

This document defines the first bounded closure gate for workflow mechanization in DME.

It is a supporting workflow note.

It does **not** override:

- `README.MasterConstitution.md`
- `README.WorkflowContract.md`
- `README.RepoLayout.md`
- `README/Constitution/Mechanization/README.DeclaredVsMechanizedAudit.md`
- `README.DeterministicInvarianceThreshold.md`

Its purpose is narrower:

- define when a capability may be called mechanized,
- prevent declared or displayed surfaces from being mistaken for implemented attainment,
- provide one first enforcement target for workflow mechanization,
- and give the repo a compact closure rule before broader schema-driven workflow work begins.

This note governs **development-workflow closure discipline** only.

It does **not** govern:

- runtime artifact meaning,
- canon activation,
- substrate semantics,
- replay semantics directly except as workflow closure targets,
- or architectural truth.

---

## 1. Why this note exists

DME now has enough helper models, execution surfaces, replay surfaces, review objects, and workflow packets that a specific distortion risk has become real:

**surface clarity can outrun mechanism.**

The repo already names this risk clearly:

- declared is not mechanized
- displayed is not mechanized
- prepared is not fulfilled
- replay-shaped is not reconstructed
- candidate is not canon

This note exists to turn that audit posture into a small operational closure gate.

---

## 2. Core rule

**A capability may be called mechanized only when its backend exists, is reachable through a real execution path, is rendered honestly on a user-facing surface, preserves explicit insufficiency/failure posture, and does not claim more than its implemented support justifies.**

Corollary rules:

- generated is not mechanized
- declared is not mechanized
- displayed is not mechanized
- prepared is not fulfilled
- partial implementation is not full attainment

If any required closure condition is missing, the capability must remain visibly below full mechanization.

Workflow mechanization does **not** itself imply mechanized engine capability.

---

## 3. Status vocabulary

The minimum workflow closure statuses are:

- `declared`
- `displayed`
- `partially_mechanized`
- `mechanized`

### `declared`

The capability has explicit posture, object shape, boundary language, or intended interface.

It does **not** yet have a real implementation path.

### `displayed`

The capability has a visible UI or read-side surface.

It may still depend on:

- static shaping,
- local state only,
- incomplete backend support,
- or manual handoff.

Displayed is not mechanized.

### `partially_mechanized`

The capability has some real implementation substance, but still lacks one or more required closure conditions.

Examples:

- backend exists but no real rendering path
- rendering exists but backend is not actually called
- failure posture is still hidden or softened
- downgrade posture is not explicit
- the surface implies more than the mechanism supports

### `mechanized`

The capability has passed the full closure gate.

It is implemented enough to count as real functional attainment at the declared seam.

Mechanized does **not** imply:

- truth
- canon
- global maturity
- permanence
- completion of all adjacent seams

Mechanized means only:
the declared bounded capability is real at its stated seam.

---

## 4. Closure criteria

A capability may be called `mechanized` only when all of the following are true:

1. **backend implementation exists**
2. **reachable from a real execution/model path**
3. **user-facing surface renders backend-produced result fields**
4. **insufficiency/failure path is explicit**
5. **downgrade posture is explicit where applicable**
6. **no stronger semantic claim is made than the backend supports**

### 4.1 Backend exists

A real implementation exists for the declared function.

This must be more than:

- an object model
- a UI shape
- a declared posture
- a placeholder contract

### 4.2 Reachability exists

The backend is actually called through a real execution, model, or integration path.

A backend file existing in the repo is not enough by itself.

Dead code is not mechanized capability.

### 4.3 User-facing rendering exists

A user-facing or operator-facing surface renders backend-produced result fields honestly.

This rule prevents the system from treating hidden backend logic as if it were already operationally visible.

### 4.4 Failure posture is explicit

If the capability fails, the failure must remain visible and local.

The system must not:

- fake success
- silently degrade into decorative output
- preserve stronger identity language than the mechanism justifies

### 4.5 Downgrade posture is explicit

Where insufficiency, retained-tier weakness, partial support, or bounded limitation exists, the capability must say so explicitly.

This is especially important for replay, reconstruction, retention, and review surfaces.

### 4.6 Semantic claim stays bounded

The surface must not claim more than the implementation actually supports.

Examples of forbidden inflation:

- replay displayed as raw restoration
- prepared request implied as fulfilled request
- candidate implied as canon
- visible review posture implied as promotion
- shaped surface implied as mechanized backend

---

## 5. Failure rule

If any closure criterion is missing, the capability must remain:

- `declared`
- `displayed`
- or `partially_mechanized`

whichever is most honest.

The system must not silently round partial attainment upward.

---

## 6. First pilot target

The first pilot target for this closure gate is:

**replay reconstruction**

This target is chosen because it recently exposed the exact declared-vs-mechanized distortion this note is meant to prevent.

For replay reconstruction, the closure gate is satisfied only when all of the following are true:

- provenance reconstruction backend exists
- replay model actually calls it
- active replay surface renders reconstruction-backed fields
- failure posture is explicit
- downgrade posture is explicit
- replay remains visibly below truth, canon, promotion, and raw restoration

This does **not** uplift canon.
This does **not** make replay restoration.
This does **not** make workflow closure a new authority layer.

---

## 7. Workflow meaning of mechanized

Workflow mechanization is not runtime mechanization.

A mechanized development workflow does not by itself imply a mechanized engine capability.

Likewise:

a mechanized engine seam does not by itself imply:

- canon readiness
- trust uplift
- workflow completion
- or permission for schema-driven code emission

This note exists only to define bounded closure at one seam.

---

## 8. Review rule

A capability should be reviewed in this order:

1. backend existence
2. reachability
3. rendered behavior
4. explicit failure posture
5. explicit downgrade posture
6. semantic boundedness

Convenience never outranks legitimacy.

---

## 9. Enforcement posture

For v0, closure-gate enforcement may remain capability-specific.

A focused enforcement test is sufficient when it:

- checks the backend seam,
- checks the model/execution reachability seam,
- checks the rendered user-facing seam,
- checks explicit failure posture,
- and checks explicit downgrade posture.

A generic framework is not required yet.

---

## 10. Small-scope rule

This closure gate should remain small and operational.

Do **not** expand it yet into:

- a giant workflow engine
- a universal schema framework
- a broad automation ontology
- or a substitute for architectural review

The first correct use of this note is:

- one README
- one focused enforcement test
- one pilot capability

---

## 11. One-line review question

Before calling any capability `mechanized`, ask:

**Can the repo prove that the backend exists, the real path reaches it, the active surface renders it honestly, and insufficiency/failure remain explicit without semantic overclaim?**

---

## 12. One-line summary

**A capability is mechanized only when declared behavior, reachable implementation, visible rendered output, and honest insufficiency/failure posture all exist together without semantic inflation.**
